# sts3-project
Project developed in the Spring React Week by DevSuperior

Production app: https://gabrielualves-sts3.netlify.app/dashboard

Might take a minute to receive data from the API because Heroku puts the app to sleep
if there is no traffic.

# Update
Because of changes in heroku this project doesn't work anymore.
